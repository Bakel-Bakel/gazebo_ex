# üß† ROS 2 Custom Robot Design & Simulation Project

Welcome to the repository for my **"ROS 2 Custom Robot Design & Simulation"** project! This project is part of my course where I design and simulate a custom robot using **ROS 2**, **TF**, **URDF**, and **Gazebo**. 

The goal of this project is to understand and implement key concepts in robot design and simulation, including **TF**, **URDF**, and **Gazebo**, and build a working application that runs in a simulated environment.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Project

In this project, I:

- Designed a **custom robot** using **ROS 2**, **URDF**, and **Gazebo**.
- Simulated the robot in **Gazebo** and control its movement and sensors.
- Created launch files to simplify the deployment of the entire system.
- Used **TF** (Transform Frames) and **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format) to describe and manage the robot‚Äôs kinematic structure.
- Implemented simulated sensors in Gazebo to provide feedback for robot navigation and control.
